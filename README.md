# Smilei_SEF

This code is developed based on Smilei: http://www.maisondelasimulation.fr/projects/Smilei/html/#
The main difference is that the electromagnetic field is changed to static electric field, and the possion solver is SuperLU for 2d, tridiagnoal for 1d. Besides, elastic collision, ionization collision and charge exchange collision are included.
